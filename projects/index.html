<p><a href=https://github.com/Jialin77777/master-course-projects/tree/master/project1><strong>Analyze the factors that influence happiness in different regions</strong></a></p>
<p>The region with high GDP, good support and high freedom score is bound to have high happiness score.
We chose the region to be one categorical variable. But it’s worth noting that some regions are significantly
happier than others, such as North America and Western Europe; Some regions have significantly lower
levels of happiness than others: South and Southeast Asia. This may be due to cultural differences, such as
religious factors, that cause people in different regions to have different views of happiness. In addition, some
countries score more than others because they might have formed complete social systems over hundreds of
years, such as more humane employment system, retirement welfare and more habitable environment, which
are more conducive to improving resident’s happiness score , even though GDP, government support and
freedom are the same.</p>
<p><a href=https://github.com/Jialin77777/master-course-projects/tree/master/project2><strong>Analysing IMDB film dataset to predict IMDB ratings</strong></a></p>
<p>The dataset observed of the analysis is just a subset of IMDB movie database, and in our model we supressed
outliers. In this paper, the rating level of 7 is considered as the standard of judging a film(good or bad). The
analysis of plethora of movies, multiple databases can be done to reduce prediction errors of IMDB ratings
in the future. This paper mainly uses a generalized linear model to analyze the data, and future work may
involves deeper analysis of films and genre.</p>
